# Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning

This repository contains slides, notes, and (optional) notebooks for the **Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning** mini-course taught by Gabriel Wendell Celestino Rocha.

## 📚 About the Course

This is a theoretical course focused exclusively on the **mathematical principles** of modern Machine Learning. It covers:

* Linear Algebra
* Probability and Information Theory
* Optimization
* Statistical Learning Theory
* Core ML models (regression, classification, PCA, etc.)
* Theoretical insights into Neural Networks and Generalization

**Important**: This is **not** a course on ML programming or implementation.
